# tree-sitter-stan

This is a [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parser for the Stan language.
It can parse the latest Stan syntax, but not all deprecated language features.

This is based off an earlier attempt by jrnold, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/jrnold/tree-sitter-stan)
